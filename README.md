### A game jam using Socket.io, canvas and JavaScript

You can [play the game here](https://)

Battle of Fried Chicken (BFC) is a HTML5/Javascript/NodeJS/Socket.io game made in 24h for the second [R2DWild](https://portfolio-r2dwild.netlify.app/) Hackathon.

The theme of the Hackathon was "Chicken" and the only instruction was to make a game that includes chickens.

It was our first game using NodeJS and Socket.io. It was a lot of fun to make and we learnt a lot.
